[x] Each day rested gives you a change of healing one member
[x] make random events
[x] logic for how going to hard/eating too little makes people sicker
[x] Hunting needs to properly update supplies
[x] resting should still make days pass / food get used...
[x] food should not go bellow 0
[x] if you arrive at a city at the same time everyone died you shouldn't see 
[x] Events ( injury/death//theft)

<!-- Fun but not necessary -->
[] Raiders mini game
[] Decentralized (Score? Wiki? nft?)
[] Traveling caravan animation
[] Choose profession
[] Restart -> currently just refresh
[] ship sinks is a tiny chance on the first leg of journey

[] pick up random member in a city... cool idea (remember we hard coded the party as 5 multiple times though...)
[] How much camels can carry effects how much you can carry

<!-- Hard -->
