[x] Too many storms... it's annoying
[x] Stuff in shop costing 0? How I'm adjusting the price is no good

[x] If you run out of food it should also show on text bar at center
[x] If you run out of food and need to go hunting continue should show as disabled

[x] log scroll buttons should change color if you can't scroll further

[x] Make buttons you can't use show up grey
[x] resting shouldn't heal thirst
[x] When changing price round
[x] Make value of objects change at each city

[x] Each day rested gives you a change of healing one member
[x] make random events
[x] logic for how going to hard/eating too little makes people sicker
[x] Hunting needs to properly update supplies

<!-- Nice to have but not necessary -->
[] Choose profession
[] Restart -> currently just refresh
[] ship sinks is a tiny chance on the first leg of journey
[] technically you shouldn't die of anything other than ship wreck on first leg of journey
[] pick up random member in a city... cool idea (remember we hard coded the party as 5 multiple times though...)
[] How much camels can carry effects how much you can carry
[] Talk
[] Make load matter in game by making camels only carry a certain amount each
[] Lily refreshed by accident and lost progress... would need restart and local storage to fix this.

<!-- Cool but not necessary -->
[x] Raiders mini game
[x] Decentralized 
[] Traveling caravan animation
[] on lose screen make background a dark gravestone

<!-- Hard -->
[x] Hunting mini game
[x] Mobile Friendly
[x] Music
[x] hover over to see what city
[x] If I need more room some buttons are the same might save space by having more than one scene they're shown on in button initiation
[] full screen on mobile... would have to improve resize function
