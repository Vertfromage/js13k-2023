# Do Important* first to have a complete game

<!-- Mobile -->
[] Resize is buggy when I implement full screen
[] When mobile goes full screen resize is broken on some phones
[] Not centered correctly on mobile

<!-- Picky -->
[] sometimes the wrong button gets set to inactive
[] Going too fast too long should cause problems... 
[] kill box

[x] shouldn't say health = good if drowned
[x] sound is dumb on mobile
[x] remove and reset all testing bits
[x] no hunting while at sea??Change animals.
[x] check if money is calculated correctly
[x] Add more story line distance based events
[x] Font in latest events is too big for ship event... and camel dead too long as well
[x] directions tap to shoot
[x] don't allow hunting if no arrows
[x] Balance random events
[x] Make sure kill box is big enough
[x] varnice typo
[x] spell check
[x] mom couldn't figure out how to shoot the arrow
[x] If no arrows no hunting
[x] don't heal thirst if dead!
[x] Resize broke click coordinates
[x] !!IMPORTANT!! fix resize function to resize to any screen!!
[x] Shoots an arrow when you click back button...
[x] When you arrive at a city anyone with thirst should heal
[x] When under attack shouldn't keep moving
[x] win screen should say how many miles and days you traveled
[x] Win Screen
[x] Too many deaths... only deaths if health !=good
[x] double tap on mobile needs to be disabled.
[x] Add some fun events...
[x] Too many storms... it's annoying
[x] Stuff in shop costing 0? How I'm adjusting the price is no good
[x] If sick with thirst when water is found heal that
[x] If you run out of food it should also show on text bar at center
[x] If you run out of food and need to go hunting continue should show as disabled
[x] Overlapping path should be different color 
[x] log fix so they don't overlap is wrong... just realized... need to use a queue
[x] don't seem to be stopping while hunting
[x] line isn't getting drawn correctly...
[x] It's saying I used more arrows than I did?
[x] Make score more complicated than just how much money... 
[x] should go from store to control page not from store to city unless first of game.
[x] log scroll buttons should change color if you can't scroll further
[x] When done hunting should go back to moving
[x] Hunting should be added to logs
[x] weather is being calculated badly
[x] Having more than one event a day...
[x] enter to submit name
[x] scroll through logs
[x] Make weather changes effect things
[x] change weather
[x] If only 2 members left they can only die from sickness not random death
[x] show dark when resting
[x] Make buttons you can't use show up grey
[x] resting shouldn't heal thirst
[x] When changing price round
[x] Make value of objects change at each city
[x] camels can die too if you run out of food
[x] If you have no camels you go very slow
[x] keep track of water consumption / stops to refill
[x] Each day rested gives you a change of healing one member
[x] make random events
[x] logic for how going to hard/eating too little makes people sicker
[x] Hunting needs to properly update supplies
[x] resting should still make days pass / food get used...
[x] food should not go bellow 0
[x] if you arrive at a city at the same time everyone died you shouldn't see 
[x] Events ( injury/death//theft) 
[x] If no tents you die by exposure, attack by animals or eaten by ants?
[x] City page (Show city description)
[x] Shop needs tweaking
[x] Control/Main Page (change settings, visit map, etc) 
[x] Time based progression
[x] Game Over lose
[x] If you run out of food/water/tents/clothes people start to starve/die of thirst/exposure
[x] negative water amounts?
[x] deaths need to be rarer...
[x] buttons should be wider
[x] problem: goes directly from mongolia to Beijing instead of back to Lanzhou - fixed by adding distance to Beijing... imperfect but good enough
[x] status page => health of members + quantity of each item ... could be store
[x] ability to change pace/rations
[x] full screen and music control buttons
[x] Enter keycode doesn't work on mobile go button
[x] Map not centered right on mobile
[] hunting music 
[] under attack music

<!-- Nice to have but not necessary -->
[] Choose profession
[] Restart -> currently just refresh
[x] ship sinks is a tiny chance on the first leg of journey
[] technically you shouldn't die of anything other than ship wreck on first leg of journey
[] pick up random member in a city... cool idea (remember we hard coded the party as 5 multiple times though...)
[x] How much camels can carry effects how much you can carry
[x] Make load matter in game by making camels only carry a certain amount each
[] Lily refreshed by accident and lost progress... would need restart and local storage to fix this.
[] kill animation
[] Prices should go down sometimes?? could hardcode price changes??
[] Shoot and kill sounds
[] Talk
[] buy medicine to heal members of caravan

<!-- Cool but not necessary -->
[x] Raiders mini game
[x] Decentralized 
[] Traveling caravan animation
[] on lose screen make background a dark gravestone

<!-- Hard -->
[x] Hunting mini game
[x] Mobile Friendly
[x] Music
[x] hover over to see what city
[x] If I need more room some buttons are the same might save space by having more than one scene they're shown on in button initiation
[] full screen on mobile... would have to improve resize function
